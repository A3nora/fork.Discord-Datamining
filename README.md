# Discord-Datamining
Datamining is done through comparing the javascript files served to the Canary Client which have different hashes per build change.

Keep in mind that a lot of build changes feature variable renaming, new tabs, newlines, etc.. which usually don't change anything on the user-side. So please take these build notes with a grain of salt.
